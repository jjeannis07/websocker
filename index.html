	<h3>Professionalism</h3>
	<p>In 2010, I attented New York City College of Technology to study Computer System Technology. Then in December 2014, I earned my Bachelor Technogy degree. Therefore, I have learned a lot by concentrating my study in Database, Networking, and Computer Security areas.I've been passionate about programming after I took two classes which were based on "Java" and "Multimedia and Mobile Device Programming", and I started to read different books on c#, PHP, and so on. Few days before the program start at NYCDA, I contact them to join the course to boost my knowledge and become a great web developer.</p><hr>

	<p>After my graduation, I received a job offer from New York City College of Technology to work as a Research Assistant. My daily tasks are assisting faculties with their data request, updating the Research Foundation database for the school department, running report for student evaluation, and submitting courses to the chair department for approval.</p>
